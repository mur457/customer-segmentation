## Project Overview
This project aims to group customers into distinct segments using the K-Means clustering algorithm based on their annual income and spending behavior. Effective customer segmentation allows businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation. By analyzing customer data, organizations can cultivate more meaningful relationships with their customers.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is derived from mall customer data and contains the following columns:
- *CustomerID*: Unique identifier for each customer.
- *Gender*: Gender of the customer (e.g., Male, Female).
- *Age*: Age of the customer.
- *Annual Income (k$)*: Annual income of the customer in thousands.
- *Spending Score (1-100)*: A score assigned to customers based on their spending behavior, calculated through a combination of factors such as purchase history.

### Data Source
The dataset can often be found in public repositories, or you may have acquired it through a specified source related to a retail or market analysis.

## Libraries Used
This project utilizes several essential libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation and analysis.
- *NumPy*: For numerical computing.
- *Matplotlib*: For generating various plots and visualizations.
- *Seaborn*: For enhanced data visualizations and themes.
- *Scikit-learn*: For implementing machine learning algorithms, specifically K-Means clustering.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project environment and run the code, please ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using:

bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


## Usage
To run the project, execute the Jupyter notebook file customer_segmentation.ipynb in a Jupyter environment. It contains step-by-step code snippets along with explanations for performing data analysis, clustering, and visualization.

### Running the Notebook
You can open and run the notebook using:

bash
Google colab notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb


## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing the dataset for analysis and clustering. The following steps are included in this project:
1. *Loading the Dataset*: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. *Handling Missing Values*: Any missing or inconsistent data is addressed.
3. *Feature Selection*: Relevant features for clustering are selected. In this case, we focused on 'Annual Income (k$)' and 'Spending Score (1-100)'.
4. *Data Normalization*: Scaling of features where necessary to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

## K-Means Clustering
The K-Means algorithm is used to segment the customers into distinct groups:
1. *Choosing the Number of Clusters*: The optimal number of clusters is determined using methods like the Elbow Method.
2. *Model Training*: The K-Means model is trained using the selected features.
3. *Cluster Prediction*: Each customer is assigned to a cluster based on feature similarity.

## Result Visualization
Visualizing the clustering results aids in understanding the segments:
1. *Scatter Plots*: Plots displaying customer distribution based on Annual Income and Spending Score, with different colors representing different clusters.
2. *Centroid Markers*: The centers of each cluster are highlighted in the plots, showing the average characteristics of each customer segment.

python
# Sample code for visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=data, x='Annual Income (k$)', y='Spending Score (1-100)', hue='Cluster', palette='Set1', s=100)
centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
plt.scatter(centers[:, 0], centers[:, 1], color='black', s=200, alpha=0.6, label='Centroids')
plt.title('Clusters of Mall Customers')
plt.xlabel('Annual Income (k$)')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()


## Conclusion
This customer segmentation project successfully groups customers based on their spending and income characteristics using K-Means clustering. The insights derived from the clustering process can help businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively and improve customer engagement.
